# Zillow Time Series Analysis

By Dave Brown

## Business Problem

A real estate firm wants to know what are the top 5 zip codes to flip homes. We must determine where we wan to look, how much data to use, and how to describe best.

1) For this project, we will only include data from New Jersey.

2) Because of the housing market crash and Hurricane Sandy, any modelling that uses only recent years may be misleading. We will use every value from 1996 to 2018 so we can the most accurate picture of home values in NJ through the years.

3) To define best, we will take the home values from the beginning and the end of the dataset to calculate the total ROI. Then, through our time series analysis, we will find the 5 zip codes with the best outlooks.
